# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest-Project-on-Red Wine Quality

I worked on a Decision Tree and Random Forest Algorithm for a data set of Red wine quality. 
We'll attempt to create a model that predicts the quality of Red wine based on its characteristics.

The following characteristics are included in this data set:
1. Alcohol: the amount of alcohol in a wine.
2. Volatile acidity: wine contains a lot of acetic acids, which gives it an unpleasant vinegar flavor.
3. Sulphates: a wine additive that increases SO2 levels while acting as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.
4. Citric Acid: a preservative that increases acidity (small quantities add freshness and flavor to wines)
5. Total Sulfur Dioxide: the sum of free and bound SO2 forms.
6. Density: sweeter wines have a higher density than dry wines.
7. Chlorides: the quantity of salt in the wine.
8. Fixed acidity refers to non-volatile acids that do not evaporate quickly.
9. pH: the acidity level
10. Free Sulfur Dioxide: It inhibits microbial growth and wine oxidation.
11. Residual sugar: the amount of sugar that remains after fermentation has stopped. The key is to achieve a perfect balance of sweetness and sourness (wines with more than 45g/ltr are sweet).
